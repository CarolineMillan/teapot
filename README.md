# teapot

This is all the code I have from my Advanced Computer Graphics coursework, rendering the Utah Teapot via photon mapping. This is not the final version of the code that I submitted. I didn't know about version control at the time I wrote this, and my laptop died not long afterwards, so this is a version I had saved to the cloud a few weeks before submission. 

This was my first introduction to coding projects larger than one or two functions. It was also my first time coding in C++, or any OOP language.

I really enjoyed this project (although this version of the code really needs to be tidied up), and have returned to path tracing as one of my first projects back after being off sick using [_Ray Tracing in One Weekend_](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html). 

I would like the return to both C++ and photon mapping in the future, and hopefully I'll write a more readable (and efficient, now that I've discovered BVH) version of this project.
